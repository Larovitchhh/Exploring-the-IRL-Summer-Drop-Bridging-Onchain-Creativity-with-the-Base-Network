The IRL Summer Drop's relation to Base stems from its integration into the Onchain Summer festival, a retro-style awards event celebrating apps and content that drive real user adoption. Base's marketing prowess shines here, as it fosters unique campaigns that blend NFTs, mini-apps, and community rewardsâ€”elements not commonly found on other blockchains.

RefractionDAO's involvement, supported by Base and Rarible, exemplifies how the network incentivizes cultural projects. Users mint via Base's ecosystem tools, earning points or roles that could tie into future rewards, such as potential airdrops from ecosystem partners. While Base itself has explored a network token (announced in September 2025), the drop focuses on immediate artistic value rather than speculative farming.

This synergy boosts Base's TVL (over $1.71 billion as of mid-2024) and attracts developers, potentially leading to more IRL-inspired drops in the future.  

 Projects like Drip's Summer Heat Packs, which combine digital reveals with physical shipments on Base, further illustrate the network's versatility for hybrid digital-physical experiences.
