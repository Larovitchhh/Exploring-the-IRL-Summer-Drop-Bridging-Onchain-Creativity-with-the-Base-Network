Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 chain built using the OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism, serves as the foundational infrastructure for the IRL Summer Drop. Known for its low fees (often sub-cent transactions) and seamless integration with Ethereum's security, Base enables efficient minting, trading, and distribution of NFTs without the high gas costs of the mainnet.  

The network's Onchain Summer campaign, which ran from July to September 2025, provided the backdrop for drops like IRL Summer #1. This initiative rewarded builders and projects with up to $250,000 in prizes, spotlighting over 250 applications for innovative mini-apps and onchain experiences. By hosting the drop on Base, RefractionDAO leverages the chain's developer-friendly environment to reach a global audience, including Coinbase's vast user base.

Base's position within the Optimism Superchain further enhances interoperability, allowing assets from the IRL Summer Drop to potentially interact across compatible chains without complex bridging. This setup not only reduces friction for users but also positions Base as a hub for cultural and artistic onchain projects.
