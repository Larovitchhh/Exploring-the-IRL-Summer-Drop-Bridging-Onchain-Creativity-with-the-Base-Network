The IRL Summer Drop is a curated NFT collection series designed to celebrate onchain creativity during the summer season. The inaugural drop, IRL Summer Drop #1, features works from five selected artists: @noahpred
, @skywaterr
, @kate_armstrong
, @heeey_eth
, and @vandilovescandi
. These pieces are minted directly through the MintR mini-app on Rarible, accessible via the Base app. This initiative is curated by RefractionDAO, an artist-owned community focused on advancing digital art, music, and culture.

Unlike traditional NFT drops that might feel purely virtual, the "IRL" branding underscores a connection to real-life inspirations and community engagement. For instance, participating artists like @kate_armstrong
 have highlighted how the drop integrates generative literature and AI-driven futures for art and design, making it a bridge between conceptual ideas and onchain ownership. The collection is available for minting at a specific Base contract address, encouraging users to interact with the ecosystem in a fun, seasonal context.  

This drop aligns with summer-themed onchain activities, where participants can collect and redeem digital rewards that evoke real-world exploration and creativity. It's part of a larger movement to make Web3 more accessible and culturally relevant, turning blockchain into a canvas for immersive experiences.
